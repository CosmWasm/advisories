# CosmWasm Advisories

We at [Confio](https://confio.gmbh/) love open source! We work in the best intent with a public review process but must accept that software can contains bugs and therefore our code, too.

In order to help with resolving any issues on production system, we have started the advisories project to link to authorized communication channels of [CosmWasm](https://cosmwasm.com/) blockchains.
Confio will inform the linked chains about **critical issues** reported to us directly on **non public channels** before opening an issue on our related projects.
Nevertheless providing this information should not prevent us or anybody else from working on a fix nor block a patch roll out.
This also does not include bugs and issues reported to us publicly via github issues or official discord channels. Chains using our projects are encouraged to **watch the github repos and official channels** on [CosmWasm discord](https://discord.com/invite/cPjEnPd) in order to maintain their own software stack.
