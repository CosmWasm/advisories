## Patch announcement

A bug in the CosmWasm stack has been discovered. This bug can potentially **lock funds** and can potentially be used to **bypass checks**.

Both 0.16 and 1.0 are equally affected. Both versions will receive a patch. Some older versions are probably affected as well but will not receive an update.

The patch is **consensus breaking**.

The release is scheduled for Wednesday, April 6th 2022 at 11am Berlin time. An update is recommended for all chains using CosmWasm.
