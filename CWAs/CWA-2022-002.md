# CWA-2022-002: Non-normalized bech32 casing in Addr type

**Affected versions:** wasmvm 0.14.x, 0.15.x, 0.16.x and 1.x<br>
**Patch expected:** 2022-04-06 11:00 Berlin time<br>
**Patched versions:** wasmvm 0.16.7 and 1.0.0-beta10 (cosmwasm-vm 0.16.7 and 1.0.0-beta8)

## Patch announcement

A bug in the CosmWasm stack has been discovered. This bug can potentially **lock funds** and can potentially be used to **bypass checks**.

Both 0.16 and 1.0 are equally affected. Both versions will receive a patch. Some older versions are probably affected as well but will not receive an update.

The patch is **consensus breaking**.

The release is scheduled for Wednesday, April 6th 2022 at 11am Berlin time. An update is recommended for all chains using CosmWasm.
