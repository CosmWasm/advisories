# CWA-2024-003: Large address count in ValidateBasic

**Severity**

Low (Moderate + Unlikely)[^1]

**Affected versions:**

- wasmd < 0.52.0

**Patched versions:** wasmd 0.52.0

## Description of the bug

In multiple wasmd message types it was possible to add a large number of addresses which might lead to unexpected resource consumption in `ValidateBasic`.

1. The following message types call [assertValidAddresses] via `func (a AccessConfig) ValidateBasic() error` to ensure the addresses are in the correct format and do not contain duplicates. An attacker can provide many addresses in `AccessConfig.Addresses` and specify the `AccessConfig.Permission` as `AccessTypeAnyOfAddresses`.

   - [MsgStoreAndInstantiateContract]
   - [MsgStoreAndMigrateContract]
   - [MsgStoreCode]
   - [MsgUpdateInstantiateConfig]
   - [MsgUpdateParams]

2. [MsgAddCodeUploadParamsAddresses] and [MsgRemoveCodeUploadParamsAddresses] call the [checkDuplicatedAddresses] function to ensure the addresses are in the correct format and do not contain duplicates. An attacker can provide many addresses in `msg.Addresses`.

Both cases may leads to a large memory consumption in the map, as well as address validation efforts and a slowdown of map operations.

The number of addresses a malicious actor can insert here is limited by the gas charged
for transaction sizes (x/auth parameter `tx_size_cost_per_byte`)
and the block size limit (CometBFT consensus setting `max_bytes`).

## Patch

The new unified [`validateBech32Addresses`] replaces `assertValidAddresses` and `checkDuplicatedAddresses`. It

1. Checks for a min and max element count
2. For each element checks
   - address validity
   - uniqueness

The check in 1. puts an upper bound on the loop in 2. as well as the size of the map `index`.

## Applying the patch

Ensure you use wasmd 0.52 or higher in your Go project:
`go list -m github.com/CosmWasm/wasmd`

Alternatively you can backport the patch from https://github.com/CosmWasm/wasmd/pull/1926.
