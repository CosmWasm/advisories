## Description of the bug

(Blank for now. We'll add more detail once chains had a chance to upgrade.)

## Patch

- 1.5: https://github.com/CosmWasm/cosmwasm/commit/16eabd681790508b13dac8e67f9e6e61045240ea
- 2.0: https://github.com/CosmWasm/cosmwasm/commit/0e70bd83119b02f99a2c0397f0913e0803750fd9
- 2.1: https://github.com/CosmWasm/cosmwasm/commit/f5bf24f3acadca2892afd58cc3ce5fdeb932d492

## Applying the patch

The patch will be shipped in releases of wasmvm. You can update more or less as follows:

1. Check the current wasmvm version: `go list -m github.com/CosmWasm/wasmvm`
2. Bump the `github.com/CosmWasm/wasmvm` dependency in your go.mod to 1.5.5, 2.0.4, 2.1.3 depending on which minor version you are; `go mod tidy`; commit.
3. If you use the static libraries `libwasmvm_muslc.aarch64.a`/`libwasmvm_muslc.x86_64.a`, update them accordingly.
4. Check the updated wasmvm version: `go list -m github.com/CosmWasm/wasmvm` and ensure you see 1.5.5, 2.0.4, 2.1.3.
5. Follow your regular practices to deploy chain upgrades.

To double check if the correct library version is loaded at runtime, use this query:
`<appd> query wasm libwasmvm-version`. It must show 1.5.5, 2.0.4 or 2.1.3.

The patch is consensus breaking and requires a coordinated upgrade.
