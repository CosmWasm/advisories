# CWA-2025-006: Improper error handling may lead to IBC channel opening despite error

**Severity**

High (Considerable + Likely)[^1]

**Affected versions:**

- wasmd 0.60.0
- wasmd >= 0.51.0 < 0.55.1

**Patched versions:**

- wasmd 0.60.1, 0.55.1, 0.54.1, 0.53.3

## Description of the bug

A contract erroring during IBC channel opening does not prevent the channel from opening.

## Applying the patch

The patch will be shipped in a wasmd release. You will also have to update `libwasmvm` if you build statically.
If you already use the latest / close to latest wasmd, you can update more or less as follows:

1. Check the current wasmd version: `go list -m github.com/CosmWasm/wasmd`
2. Bump the `github.com/CosmWasm/wasmd` dependency in your go.mod to 0.60.1 (Cosmos SDK 0.53 compatible), 0.55.1 (Cosmos SDK 0.50 compatible), 0.54.1 or 0.53.3; `go mod tidy`; commit.
3. If you use the static libraries `libwasmvm_muslc.aarch64.a`/`libwasmvm_muslc.x86_64.a`, make sure that you use the same version as your wasmvm version.
4. Check the updated wasmd version: `go list -m github.com/CosmWasm/wasmd` and ensure you see 0.60.1, 0.55.1, 0.54.1 or 0.53.3.
5. Follow your regular practices to deploy chain upgrades.

The patch is consensus breaking.
