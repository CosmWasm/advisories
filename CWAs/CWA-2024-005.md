**Severity**

High (Critical + Likely)[^1]

**Patched versions:** wasmd 0.53.0, 0.46.0

## Description of the bug

(Blank for now. We'll add more detail once chains had a chance to upgrade.)

## Patch

- 0.53.0 (`main` branch): <https://github.com/CosmWasm/wasmd/commit/db8981db8419fc4daa042ce04e279efb53c4ff29>
- 0.46.0 (`releases/v0.4x` branch): <https://github.com/CosmWasm/wasmd/commit/71cf6a8145426b82ed6249ecc86ddd281af9f97b>

## Applying the patch

The patch will be shipped in a wasmd release. You can update more or less as follows:

1. Check the current wasmd version: `go list -m github.com/CosmWasm/wasmd`
2. Bump the `github.com/CosmWasm/wasmd` dependency in your go.mod to 0.53.0 (Cosmos SDK 0.50 compatible) or 0.46.0 (Cosmos SDK 0.47 compatible) depending on which version you are on right now; `go mod tidy`; commit.
3. If you use the static libraries `libwasmvm_muslc.aarch64.a`/`libwasmvm_muslc.x86_64.a`, make sure that you use the same version as your wasmvm version.
4. Check the updated wasmd version: `go list -m github.com/CosmWasm/wasmd` and ensure you see 0.53.0 or 0.46.0.
5. Follow your regular practices to deploy chain upgrades.
