# CWA-2023-002: Stack overflow crash (Codename Cherry)

**Affected versions:**

- cosmwasm-vm < 1.0.1, < 1.1.10, < 1.2.4
- wasmvm < 1.0.1, < 1.1.2, < 1.2.3

**Patched versions:**

- wasmvm 1.0.1 (cosmwasm-vm 1.0.1)
- wasmvm 1.1.2 (cosmwasm-vm 1.1.10)
- wasmvm 1.2.3 (cosmwasm-vm 1.2.4)

## Description of the bug

The bug allows a recursive loop between guest and host using Wasm imports and exports, leading to a stack overflow crash of the VM.

A malicious contract can implement exports such as `extern "C" fn allocate(size: usize) -> u32` differently than the standard library does. By calling a Wasm import such as `addr_validate` in the `allocate` implementation, the loop looks like

- contracts calls import `addr_validate`
- host calls export `allocate`
- contracts calls import `addr_validate`
- host calls export `allocate`
- contracts calls import `addr_validate`
- ...

After approximately 140 recursions, the process crashes with a stack overflow.

Non-malicious contracts can not trigger the loop as the regular uses of cosmwasm-std only have a call depths of up to 2.

A call depth limit fixes the problem.

## Patch Announcement

> Tomorrow, on Tuesday, April 18th at 17:00 Berlin time (15h UTC/ 8am Pacific Time) Confio will release a fix for a medium severity security issue in CosmWasm. The patch for this issue will be distributed and communicated via the regular CosmWasm release process.
>
> This issue impacts the availability of a chain running CosmWasm, and could allow for a malicious contract to trigger a crash that can halt the chain. Though chains that use CosmWasm with permissioned uploads or instantiation are not directly at risk, we advise chains that support permissionless contract instantiation to be prepared to apply the patch and to coordinate network upgrades as quickly as their processes allow to fully remediate the issue.
>
> The patch is not a consensus breaking security fix and can be applied in-place, and instructions will be provided to all maintainers tomorrow as part of the release process. We anticipate that the patch will be a simple, straightforward fix for chain maintainers as it is a matter of replacing one Go dependency and rebuilding the application.

## Patch

The actual patch is done in the codebase of cosmwasm-vm:
https://github.com/CosmWasm/cosmwasm/commit/3795f5cd03288405335d4fb0c46c239dbf4c7e60

It is included in the following releases:

- [cosmwasm-vm 1.0.1](https://github.com/CosmWasm/cosmwasm/compare/v1.0.0...v1.0.1)
- [cosmwasm-vm 1.1.10](https://github.com/CosmWasm/cosmwasm/compare/v1.1.9...v1.1.10)
- [cosmwasm-vm 1.2.4](https://github.com/CosmWasm/cosmwasm/compare/v1.2.3...v1.2.4)

### Patch release

The patch is shipped to chain developers in the form of a wasmvm release.
Your chain might depend on wasmvm directly or have it as a transitive dependency through wasmd.

The upgrade paths are the following:

| Current wasmvm version | Upgrade path                                  | Note |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ---- |
| < 1.0.0                | Unsupported                                   | [^1] |
| 1.0.0                  | Upgrade wasmvm to 1.0.1                       |      |
| 1.1.1                  | Upgrade wasmvm to 1.1.2                       |      |
| 1.2.0                  | Upgrade to 1.2.2 first, then upgrade to 1.2.3 | [^2] |
| 1.2.1                  | Upgrade wasmvm to 1.2.3                       | [^3] |
| 1.2.2                  | Upgrade wasmvm to 1.2.3                       |      |

[^1]: Upgrade to any of the supported versions first.
[^2]: See https://github.com/CosmWasm/wasmvm/issues/419 for required wasmd changes
[^3]: No typo. You can skip 1.2.2 and upgrade from 1.2.1 -> 1.2.3 directly.

### Applying the patch

1. Go tho the Go project containing the `go.mod`.
2. One of those:
   - If there is a direct `github.com/CosmWasm/wasmvm` dependency listed already, update that to 1.0.1, 1.1.2 or 1.2.3 as listed above. Run .
   - Otherwise you have `wasmvm` as an indirect dependency of wasmd. Use `go list -m github.com/CosmWasm/wasmvm` to get the current version and then use `go mod edit -replace github.com/CosmWasm/wasmvm=github.com/CosmWasm/wasmvm@v<NEW WASMVM VERSIO>` where `<NEW WASMVM VERSION>` is one of 1.0.1, 1.1.2 or 1.2.3 as listed above.
3. Run `go mod tidy` to download the dependency and update `go.sum`
4. Check the resulting version after the replace `go list -m github.com/CosmWasm/wasmvm`.
5. Build, test, deploy according to your project's established flow.

After building your chain, you can check the libwasmvm version loaded at runtime with

```sh
# Replace <node> with you node name
<node> query wasm libwasmvm-version
```

### Wasm module cache issue

If you upgrade from wasmvm 1.2.{0,1} to wasmvm 1.2.{2,3} please note that
most likely the machine format of the compiled Wasm modules has changed,
potentially leading to segmentation faults when running the new binary.

To avoid this problem, instruct your validators to delete the cache folder
`<node home>/wasm/wasm/cache/` (replace with the location your project uses)
after they stopped the node.
