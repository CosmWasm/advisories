**Affected versions:**

- wasmvm < 1.0.1, < 1.1.2, < 1.2.3

**Patched versions:**

- wasmvm 1.2.3 (cosmwasm-vm 1.2.4)

## Patch

The patch is shipped to chain developers in the form of a wasmvm release.
Your chain might depend on wasmvm directly or have it as a transitive dependency through wasmd.

The upgrade paths are the following:

| Current wasmvm version | Upgrade path                                  | Note |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ---- |
| < 1.0.0                | Unsupported                                   | [^1] |
| 1.0.0                  | Upgrade wasmvm to 1.0.1                       |      |
| 1.1.1                  | Upgrade wasmvm to 1.1.2                       |      |
| 1.2.0                  | Upgrade to 1.2.2 first, then upgrade to 1.2.3 | [^2] |
| 1.2.1                  | Upgrade wasmvm to 1.2.3                       | [^3] |
| 1.2.2                  | Upgrade wasmvm to 1.2.3                       |      |

[^1]: Upgrade to any of the supported versions first.
[^2]: See https://github.com/CosmWasm/wasmvm/issues/419 for required wasmd changes
[^3]: No typo. You can skip 1.2.2 and upgrade from 1.2.1 -> 1.2.3 directly.

### Applying the patch

1. Go tho the Go project containing the `go.mod`.
2. One of those:
   - If there is a direct `github.com/CosmWasm/wasmvm` dependency listed already, update that to 1.0.1, 1.1.2 or 1.2.3 as listed above. Run .
   - Otherwise you have `wasmvm` as an indirect dependency of wasmd. Use `go list -m github.com/CosmWasm/wasmvm` to get the current version and then use `go mod edit -replace github.com/CosmWasm/wasmvm=github.com/CosmWasm/wasmvm@v<NEW WASMVM VERSIO>` where `<NEW WASMVM VERSION>` is one of 1.0.1, 1.1.2 or 1.2.3 as listed above.
3. Run `go mod tidy` to download the dependency and update `go.sum`
4. Check the resulting version after the replace `go list -m github.com/CosmWasm/wasmvm`.
5. Build, test, deploy according to your project's established flow.

After building your chain, you can check the libwasmvm version loaded at runtime with

```sh
# Replace <node> with you node name
<node> query wasm libwasmvm-version
```
