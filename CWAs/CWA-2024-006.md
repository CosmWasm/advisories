**Affected versions:**

**Patched versions:** wasmd 0.53.0

## Description of the bug

(Blank for now. We'll add more detail once chains had a chance to upgrade.)

## Applying the patch

The patch will be shipped in a wasmd release. You can update more or less as follows:

1. Check the current wasmd version: `go list -m github.com/CosmWasm/wasmd`
2. Bump the `github.com/CosmWasm/wasmd` dependency in your go.mod to 0.53.0; `go mod tidy`; commit.
3. If you use the static libraries `libwasmvm_muslc.aarch64.a`/`libwasmvm_muslc.x86_64.a`, make sure that you use the same version as your wasmvm version.
4. Check the updated wasmd version: `go list -m github.com/CosmWasm/wasmd` and ensure you see 0.53.0.
5. Follow your regular practices to deploy chain upgrades.
