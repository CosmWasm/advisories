# CWA-2024-002: Arithmetic overflows in cosmwasm-std

**Severity**

Medium

**Affected versions:**

- cosmwasm-std >= 2.0.0, < 2.0.2
- cosmwasm-std >= 1.5.0, < 1.5.4
- cosmwasm-std >= 1.3.0, < 1.4.4

**Patched versions:** cosmwasm-std 1.4.4, 1.5.4, 2.0.2

## Description of the bug

Some mathematical operations in `cosmwasm-std` use wrapping math instead of
panicking on overflow for very big numbers. This can lead to wrong calculations in contracts
that use these operations.

Affected functions:

- `Uint{256,512}::pow` / `Int{256,512}::pow`
- `Int{256,512}::neg` (the unary negation operator `-`). The only value that can overflow is `Int{256,512}::MIN`.

Affected if `overflow-checks = true` is not set:

- `Uint{64,128}::pow` / `Int{64,128}::pow`
- `Int{64,128}::neg` (the unary negation operator `-`). The only value that can overflow is `Int{64,128}::MIN`.

## Patch

- 1.4: https://github.com/CosmWasm/cosmwasm/commit/607e7fc710fb9441096e8edbaa12879b552c8f65
- 1.5: https://github.com/CosmWasm/cosmwasm/commit/eff79bcbe73b61178817aacf0a6449437adad6a9
- 2.0: https://github.com/CosmWasm/cosmwasm/commit/a6a639e09adc355b5f889a09141649005cb08a46

## Applying the patch

1. Run `cargo update -p cosmwasm-std` in your contract's project
2. Ensure the version of "cosmwasm-std" in `Cargo.lock` is 1.4.4, 1.5.4 or 2.0.2
