# CWA-2024-001: Arithmetic overflows in cosmwasm-std

**Severity**

Medium

**Affected versions:**

- cosmwasm-std >= 2.0.0, < 2.0.2
- cosmwasm-std >= 1.5.0, < 1.5.4
- cosmwasm-std >= 1.4.0, < 1.4.4

**Patched versions:** cosmwasm-std 1.4.4, 1.5.4, 2.0.2

## Description of the bug

Some mathematical operations in `cosmwasm-std` use wrapping math instead of
panicking on overflow for very big numbers. This can lead to wrong calculations in contracts
that use these operations.

## Applying the patch

1. Run `cargo update -p cosmwasm-std` in your contract's project
2. Ensure the version of "cosmwasm-std" in `Cargo.lock` is 1.4.4, 1.5.4 or 2.0.2
